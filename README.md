WalletBuddy is an application built with the Django framework.
This finance application allows users to track their expenses and spending habits, create budgets and transactions, and track their incomes.

## Technologies Used
WalletBuddy uses the following technologies:

- Django: a Python web framework for building web applications
- JavaScript: for visualizations and interactivity on the dashboard
- Chart.js: a JavaScript library for visualizing data in charts
- Bootstrap: a popular CSS framework for building responsive websites
- AWS: a cloud computing platform that provides scalable and reliable services for hosting, storage, and other infrastructure needs



This is not a finished product. There are still bugs that needs to be fixed, and I will continue on improving the application overtime.

## Disclaimer
WalletBuddy is for development purposes only and is not intended for use in production.
